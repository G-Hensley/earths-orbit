# 🌍 Earth's Orbit

A browser-based animation showing the Earth and Moon orbiting the Sun in real time. No libraries, no frameworks — just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript handling the motion and layering.

Built for fun, exploration, and a break from CRUD apps.

## 🌐 What It Does

- Animates the Moon orbiting a rotating Earth
- Animates the Earth orbiting a glowing Sun
- Uses CSS keyframes and transform logic to simulate orbital motion
- Renders smoothly without a canvas or physics engine

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **HTML** – structure
- **CSS** – animations, keyframes, transforms
- **JavaScript** – setup and structural logic
- **Assets** – royalty-free planet images from Freepik

## 🎯 Why I Built It

I’ve always been into space and astronomy, so this was a way to mess with CSS animation while visualizing something I actually care about. It started as a random idea — ended up being a clean, looping orbit sim that taught me a few things about layering, transform origins, and keeping animations lightweight.

Also, not everything has to be a productivity tool or a dashboard. Sometimes it's just about seeing if you can pull something off with basic tools.
