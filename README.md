# earths-orbit

# Description:
Animation that shows the moon revolving and rotating around the earth that is rotating and revolving around the sun.
This project was built to just have fun with CSS animations.
I sourced images from websites like freepik.com for the Earth, Sun, and Moon.

#Technologies used:
  HTML
  CSS
  JavaScript

# Inspiration:
I love astronomy, so I thought it would be really fun to build a small solar system diagram that's animated.
